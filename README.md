# Financial_Fraud_Detection_System
A high-performance machine learning pipeline designed to detect fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced financial data. This project implements a "Champion-Challenger" model approach, comparing Logistic Regression (Baseline) against Random Forest (Champion) to optimize for fraud-specific metrics like Precision-Recall AUC.
